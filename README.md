# Automated Licence Plate Detection and Recognition for Bangladeshi Vehicles

We have developed a 3 layered license plate detection and recognition system for Bangladeshi vehicles. The first layer detects license plate from images, second layer is used to segment characters, words and digits from detected license plates and the last phase is for recognizing those segments and predict corresponding labels. The end-to-end model can be seen in fig below.
